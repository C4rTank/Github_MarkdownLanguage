# Clockwork Bow #

The **Clockwork Bow** is a craftable ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8260a9f7-4982-4b00-911a-57cda698cc2d) **post-Moon Lord** bow. When holding left click with the bow, 
precision bolts are slowly loaded into it, up to a maximum of six. The bolts are homing and can
pass through solid tiles, but cannot pierce enemies. Each arrow loaded reduces the time taken to 
load the next arrow by **5%**. Whenever an arrow is loaded, the text ***Tick*** or ***Tock*** shows up above 
the player in alternating order.
